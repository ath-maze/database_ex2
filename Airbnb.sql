of fun things to do in the area For example Harvard Avenue is filled with tons of restaurant and bar options However the area can be a bit dingy and rowdy on weekends Occasionally there will be a loud wandering drove of drunk college kids on a weeknight Its just part of what makes Allston so interesting Housing in the area is in general pretty cheap and shabby Sa has done what he can to make sure the place is neat and clean but these buildings are old and not well maintained by their landlords The floors are creaky the water pressure leaves something to be desired and the radiators are always on full blast even when it is warm and muggy out hint of advice keep those windows open when you are in the apartment and if youd like privacy pull down those shades and stack something like books on it so the shades dont fly everywhere due to wind Even when it is cold outside the radiator will overheat the room very quickly These factors pushed me out of my comfort several times but if you are young and dont mind that much for these things its a good bedroom to have which an acceptable kitchen and bathroom set up\n\nAgain Sa has done what he can to keep the place nice However the above are inherent factors in Allston which you cannot avoid If those things are acceptable for you and youll be spending most of your time out anyways then the place is good But if you are expecting a quiet

everything by driving or Uber The only complaint we had was the check in time was 4pm and when we arrived the cleaning lady had just arrived to clean She said it would only take her 12 hours so we left to shop and waste time and came back after 25 hours and it still wasnt done I dont think the hosts expected the cleaning lady to be so late as she told us she was supposed to be there earlier in the day to get started so we didnt hold that against them  We got a hotel for the night since we had 2 small children and they needed to eat dinner and be in bed After a few weeks of being in the home there was a small leak from the ac unit but the hosts immediately addressed the situation and had it taken care of even on a holiday weekend The hosts responded quickly and were always friendly They even left Easter gifts for our 2 boys which was super sweet and my kids loved it The neighbors all seemed friendly 1 parking spot behind the house and then street parking We had no issues with Amazon

proximity to the hospital Unfortunately our stay in Rochester began because one of our newly born twins was extremely ill and required an extended stay in the NICU and surgery brTHIS is where our satisfaction with the house turned into total admiration and appreciation for the hosts As soon as Lilian and her Airbnb partner  Claire knew our circumstance they started working together to make special accommodations for us so that we could move into  this property before it was even due to be listed They so clearly accelerated the timelines so that we could get settled and not have to continue to move with our other newborn twin in tow  brLilian and her partner Eric offered to bring us anything we needed and help in any way   When we arrived she had purchased babyfriendly soaps and a bottle drying wrack among other things to help us begin our journey as parents  They checked in with us consistently to see i there  was anything we needed every step of the way  They even brought a little Easter kit so we could actually sit down and have a meal as a family something we did not think we would be doing given our circumstances  brThey proved to us that they so clearly put PEOPLE

say that Nikki was very responsive responded fast there was a few things that I was not happy about with this rental there was clear instructions on how to get to the back door First  thing I noticed when entering the door was there was an old mop smell as soon as you walk in as if it was mopped with old dirty water I had to go to the store and buy a plugin to plug it in so it didnt smell I did not notify Nikki of the smell When getting into the bed there was two very long pieces of hair in the sheets I also did not notify Nikki about this either The AC was not controlled from inside the unit I had to ask for it to be turned on and once turned on we were freezing throughout the night The pool was not clean which was very upsetting because we did not get the chance to use the pool and it was 90 outside We were not notified that the pool would be unavailable Which is very upsetting because that was the reason I selected this rental','2025-03-18 19:45:05'),(2606,2605,6966,4.0,'Thats
